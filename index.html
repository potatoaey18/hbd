                            Today is all about you—your kindness, your strength, and your love for this country. I know the future can feel uncertain sometimes, but never forget how amazing you are and how much you’re meant to do.
                            Your passion for serving others shows how brave and selfless you are. I have no doubt that you’ll make a difference wherever you go. No matter what challenges come, remember that you’re never alone. I’ll always be here, believing in you even when you doubt yourself.
                           <br> The country is lucky to have someone like you, <br>and I’m even luckier to have you in my life.
                            <br>Keep going, my love. <br>This is just the beginning. ❤️ <br>
                            Happy Birthday! 🎂🎉🎁
